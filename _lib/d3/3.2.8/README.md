@ndarville of `d3-charts`'s note: The version of d3.js used here is `3.2.8`, because newer versions break the grids in certain charts, and furthermore, it is possible that versions beyond `3.2.8` will break the charts in other ways.

All charts in `d3-charts` specify the `d3.js` version by a query string of the type `?v=3.2.8`, so you can always tell, which version of `d3.js` the chart has been created and tested with.
